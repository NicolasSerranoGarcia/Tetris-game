// START DATE OF THE PROJECT: 02/04/2025
//
//
// MADE BY NICOLAS SERRANO GARC√çA - FIRST YEAR COMPUTER ENGINEER AT UNIVERSITY OF ALICANTE (AT DATE OF CREATION)
//
//
// THANKS TO: 
//  - The Builder (https://www.youtube.com/@TheBuilder) for teaching me the basics of SDL
//  - Tetris (https://tetris.com/play-tetris) for letting me visualize and play arround with the mechanics of the game
//  - Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts I used in the project
//
//
// ABOUT: This project was made from scratch by me. To be honest, I first thought of doing this project right before finishing two C based projects (Pacman and Snake)
//  which by the way you can also find on my github profile. My first idea was to use the linux command line as a visual engine, also using SDL but on a lower level.
//  Turns out on second semester of first year I'm learning OOP by using C++. I knew SDL was commonly used with C++ so I thought of this.
//
//  When I started coding, I literally knew how to create a class with a .h and .cc, declaring methods on public and atributes on private. Little to nothing. This project has also
//  been a way to learn some more advanced things like object polimorfhism using abstract classes and virtual methods, dynamic pointers... I've had to deal with a lot of header
//  handling so I have also learnt a bit of make. Other things like .gitignore have been really usefull with a project of this size. I've never made something bigger than 2 files.
//  This is also the first time I've used git and Github in the correct way (I think). I really like this tool. Overall, I have learnt a LOT of things. Rn developing games
//  is the most direct way for me of learning. Follow my github to check out on some other projects I'll be developing in the future.
//
//
//  LICENSE: This project has absolutely no license nor it is aimed to profit me in any financial way. If anything, it is a way for me to show my apreciation for retro
//  games and an attempt to recreate one
//
//  Thanks for reading and enjoy my implementation of tetris ;)

// The general structure of the project consists of several scenes that switch via events (like button presses or death cases). This scenes are supported by auxilary classes
// like Font or Button that implement SDL functionalities in a fast-access way. There's a pointer to the current scene that switches depending on the events.

#include "Font/Font.h"
#include "Button/Button.h"
#include "Scene/Scene.h"
#include "Scene/Scenes.h"        //This is just a file with all the #include "eachScene.h"
#include "constants/constants.h" //Contains things like SDL_Color colors, positioning variables and so

#include <iostream>

Scene *mainScene = nullptr;

        std::cerr << "TTF_Init Error: " << TTF_GetError() << std::endl;
        SDL_Quit();
