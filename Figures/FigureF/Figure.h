//This class serves as an abstract father class of the figures. Almost any aspect of a figure
//can be generalized in this class. This class holds methods for rotating, deleting blocks, rendering...
//IMPORTANT: There are several things that each child must implement in it's own way, like the actual
//position of the blocks (which is diferent for every figure). It is worth to mention that anything related
//with the building or rotating of the figure is based on the leading block. Keep it in mind when looking
//at the build process of every figure, as you may see something like leadingBlock - 1. It is important that
//the leading block is correctly updated.
