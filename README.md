## Overview

**Tetris-game** is a modern take on the classic Tetris game, developed in C++ using the SDL2 library as a multimedia API. This project offers an open source code with a lot of fun, fancy [features](#features)!

### Key Features

- üéÆ **Gameplay Mechanics:** Core Tetris rules implemented for a faithful experience.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Real-Time Interaction:** Smooth response to user input for seamless gameplay.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Sounds and Music:** With volume control and a radio to choose songs.
- üåå **Scene Management:** Efficient handling of scene transitions and updates.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Keybind mapping:** Keybinds can be changed for a better experience.
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è **Many more:** Play to try all the features!

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before building and running the game, make sure you have:

- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04+ (or similar Linux distro)
- **Compiler:** g++ (GCC) 9.3.0 or later
- **Libraries:** SDL2, SDL2_ttf, SDL_Image, SDL_Mixer

### Installation
To install the required libraries on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
```

To clone the repo locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NicolasSerranoGarcia/Tetris-game.git
cd Tetris-game
```

To compile the game into an executable:

```bash
make
```
Note: The executable will be named "tetris" and will be located on the repo clone

To run the game:
```bash
./tetris
```

### Usage

This project is **open source**, and by no means it is aimed to benefit me in any financial way! The motivation behind this project is solely a **desire to learn** and overcome new obstacles. Feel free to **fork** the project and make any changes you find useful. You can also contact me via any of my [socials](linktr.ee/NicolasSerrano) if you need any information related to the project. I'm open to talk!

### Testing

This project has **no** QA testing. Every aspect has been designed and implemented correctly, but things go off very easily. If you encounter any unexpected behavior during your gameplay, you can report it via any of the socials listed [here](linktr.ee/NicolasSerrano). You can also open a pull request if your goal is to fix it yourself. Please note that problems may arise if you try to execute this program outside of the requirements listed at the beginning.

## Project Structure

The project follows a simple structure. A loop will run indefinitely until the program (window) is closed. Inside the loop, there are two main functions: 
- ***First***, the program checks all the **events** that have been triggered since the last loop run. Each event is taken care individually until there are no events left. 
- ***Then***, the program takes care of the **rendering** and the **logic**.
<!-- Insert the excalidraw schema and maybe a UML diagram-->
![Program schema](docs/flow-diagram.png)

There are 4 different **scenes**. The user can change between scenes by pressing certain buttons, keys or loosing the game. The structure holds for each of the scenes, but each method will execute different code depending on which scene the program is on. There are auxiliary classes that use functionalities from SDL such as *Image*, *Font* or *Button*. Next is a UML diagram of the classes inside the program. The diagram doesn't show all the methods and attributes, only the essential ones for understanding the relationships.
<!-- Show a photo of each scene -->

![UML Diagram](docs/UML-Diagram.png)

Additionally, auxiliary classes like *Button*, *Image* or *Font* can be loaded temporarily (not as an atributte) on any point of the code. These are not reflected in the diagram.

Every class is built to sustain the class Scene and it's childs. These classes can be used as a template for other SDL projects, so feel free to use them as you wish :).

## Features

Here is a list of features and functionalities that enhance the user experience:

<!-- Do every gif or video as if you were a bot inside a tutorial of an official game (imagine fortnite or an installation guide gif) -->

- Distinct **scenes** that add ambient to the program: an *opening scene*, a *settings scene*, a *gameplay scene* and a *death scene*. The death scene lets you go to the opening scene, play again or open the settings.

<!--Inert photo of each scene -->

</p>

Gameplay features: 

- The next three figures to be played can be visualized while playing.

</p>

Miscellaneous features:

- The key binds associated with each action can be changed inside the settings. They are <ins>saved locally</ins>, so the next time the program is opened they are automatically loaded.

<!-- Insert a gif of changing the key binds, and maybe closing the program and opening it again to show -->

</p>

- There are **sound effects** and background **music**. The volume of both of them can be controlled inside the settings, using two sliders. There is also a radio used to skip, rewind and stop the music. There are 44 songs chosen randomly and automatically if the radio is ignored
<!-- Insert a video with audio of using the radio -->

</p>
  

- The **stats** of the best game are shown in the opening scene. The top 5 is saved locally, so the program can be closed without loosing the progress

<!-- Show an example of this -->
<p align = "center" >

</p>

- My **main socials** are shown as **buttons** inside the settings. Clicking them will open a browser pop up redirecting to each

<!-- Show a gif clicking the buttons -->

Here is a list of other (micro) features that further enhance the gameplay experience:


- Inside the settings, the buttons that are partially shown cannot be triggered on the zones that are not visible

<!-- show an example of pressing a button-->
<p align = "center" >
<img src = "https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExajE1bGJqYXMwdW82N3NhdDl2dHlhazM0eGx4Nzk5c3V5NWNpaGs2bSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/ccRrcecpw9PaM/giphy.gif" alt = "Scene photos"></img>
</p>

- When a key bind button is pressed, other buttons and sliders can **still** be triggered. The pressed button will still be waiting for a key to be pressed.

## About

I've always been fascinated by game creation‚Äîespecially retro games like *Mario Bros* on the NES or *Mario 64*. It's incredible how much can be accomplished within the hardware limitations of those consoles. As a first-year Computer Engineering student, I'm glad I've taken courses in Assembly and Computer Architecture. They‚Äôve allowed me to peek into the source code of these games without feeling overwhelmed.

**SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)** is a low-level multimedia library that provides control over fundamental components like event handling, window creation, and canvas drawing. While it's commonly used as a windowing layer for applications like OpenGL, SDL can function as a standalone module.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è SDL is **not** a game engine.  
It only offers the bare tools you need to build something from scratch‚Äîwhat you do with them is entirely up to you.

Of course, writing a project in Assembly is very different from using SDL. SDL abstracts the process of accessing hardware directly (for input, drawing, etc.), but it brings you closer to the hardware than high-level engines. Creating this project has been a real challenge: it pushed me to think deeply about the core functionalities of a game like *Tetris* and to implement them in a way that feels natural and intuitive.

I'm aware that my code is far from perfect. It lacks proper design patterns and other architectural considerations‚Äîbut I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve achieved. I encountered many obstacles, thought them through, and managed to overcome them.

Sure, I could‚Äôve made a simple screen where you just play *Tetris*. But I wanted to go further. I wanted to create something personal‚Äîsomething where I could add features I find interesting or useful.

This project is recreational. It‚Äôs a learning journey, and I‚Äôve truly enjoyed every part of it.  
I hope you enjoy what I‚Äôve built and have fun with the gameplay experience. :)

Thanks for reading and enjoy this project!
