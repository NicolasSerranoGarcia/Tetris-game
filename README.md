./tetris
```

### Usage

This project is **open source**, and by no means it is aimed to benefit me in any financial way! The motivation behind this project is solely a **desire to learn** and overcome new obstacles. Feel free to **fork** the project and make any changes you find useful. You can also contact me via any of my [socials](linktr.ee/NicolasSerrano) if you need any information related to the project. I'm open to talk!

### Testing

This project has **no** QA testing. Every aspect has been designed and implemented correctly, but things go off very easily. If you encounter any unexpected behavior during your gameplay, you can report it via any of the socials listed [here](linktr.ee/NicolasSerrano). You can also open a pull request if your goal is to fix it yourself. Please note that problems may arise if you try to execute this program outside of the requirements listed at the beginning.

## Project Structure

The project follows a simple structure. A loop will run indefinitely until the program (window) is closed. Inside the loop, there are two main functions: 
- ***First***, the program checks all the **events** that have been triggered since the last loop run. Each event is taken care individually until there are no events left. 
- ***Then***, the program takes care of the **rendering** and the **logic**.
<!-- Insert the excalidraw schema and maybe a UML diagram-->
![Program schema](docs/flow-diagram.png)

There are 4 different **scenes**. The user can change between scenes by pressing certain buttons, keys or loosing the game. The structure holds for each of the scenes, but each method will execute different code depending on which scene the program is on. There are auxiliary classes that use functionalities from SDL such as *Image*, *Font* or *Button*. Next is a UML diagram of the classes inside the program. The diagram doesn't show all the methods and attributes, only the essential ones for understanding the relationships.
<!-- Show a photo of each scene -->

![UML Diagram](docs/UML-Diagram.png)

Additionally, auxiliary classes like *Button*, *Image* or *Font* can be loaded temporarily (not as an atributte) on any point of the code. These are not reflected in the diagram.

Every class is built to sustain the class Scene and it's childs. These classes can be used as a template for other SDL projects, so feel free to use them as you wish :).

## Features

Here is a list of features and functionalities that enhance the user experience:

<!-- Do every gif or video as if you were a bot inside a tutorial of an official game (imagine fortnite or an installation guide gif) -->

- Distinct **scenes** that add ambient to the program: an *opening scene*, a *settings scene*, a *gameplay scene* and a *death scene*. The death scene lets you go to the opening scene, play again or open the settings.

<!--Inert photo of each scene -->

</div>

Gameplay features: 

- The next three figures to be played can be visualized while playing.
  
<!-- Insert a gif of using all the functionalities -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/next-figures(2).gif" />
</div>
  
- A figure can be **swapped** with another saved previously

<!-- Insert a gif of using all the functionalities -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/swap(3).gif" />
</div>

- A figure can be dropped to the bottom of the game board instantly (fast drop)
  
<!-- Insert a gif of using all the functionalities -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/fast-drop(4).gif" />
</div>

- The figures can be **rotated** clockwise and anticlockwise

<!-- Insert a gif of using all the functionalities -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/rotation(5).gif" />
</div>

Miscellaneous features:

- The key binds associated with each action can be changed inside the settings. They are <ins>saved locally</ins>, so the next time the program is opened they are automatically loaded.

<!-- Insert a gif of changing the key binds, and maybe closing the program and opening it again to show -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/keybinds(6).gif" />
</div>

- There are **sound effects** and background **music**. The volume of both of them can be controlled inside the settings, using two sliders. There is also a radio used to skip, rewind and stop the music. There are 44 songs chosen randomly and automatically if the radio is ignored
<!-- Insert a video with audio of using the radio -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/sound(7).gif" />
</div>

- There is a **slider** to scroll through the settings. The mouse wheel can also be used for this purpose
  
<!-- Insert gif of using the mouse wheel and the slider -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/slider(8).gif" />
</div>

- There is a **countdown** that triggers when the settings is closed to let the user prepare to resume the game
  
<!-- show the countdown -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/countdown(9).gif" />
</div>
  

- The **stats** of the best game are shown in the opening scene. The top 5 is <ins>saved locally</ins>, so the program can be closed without loosing the progress

<!-- Show an example of this -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/stats(10).png" />
</div>

- My **main socials** are shown as **buttons** inside the settings. Clicking them will open a browser pop up redirecting to each

<!-- Show a gif clicking the buttons -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/socials(11).gif" />
</div>

Here is a list of other (micro) features that further enhance the gameplay experience:


- Inside the settings, the buttons that are partially shown cannot be triggered on the zones that are not visible

<!-- show an example of pressing a button-->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/buttons(12).gif" />
</div>

- When a key bind button is pressed, other buttons and sliders can **still** be triggered. The pressed button will still be waiting for a key to be pressed.

<!-- Show a gif of this -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/buttons(12).gif" />
</div>

- When in the settings, the figures of the current gameplay are **not shown** to prevent cheating
  
<!-- Show an example of closing and opening the settings -->
<div align = "center">
  <img src = "src/Media/showcase-media/cheating(13).gif" />
</div>

## About

I've always been fascinated by game creation‚Äîespecially retro games like *Mario Bros* on the NES or *Mario 64*. It's incredible how much can be accomplished within the hardware limitations of those consoles. As a first-year Computer Engineering student, I'm glad I've taken courses in Assembly and Computer Architecture. They‚Äôve allowed me to peek into the source code of these games without feeling overwhelmed.

**SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)** is a low-level multimedia library that provides control over fundamental components like event handling, window creation, and canvas drawing. While it's commonly used as a windowing layer for applications like OpenGL, SDL can function as a standalone module.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è SDL is **not** a game engine.  
It only offers the bare tools you need to build something from scratch‚Äîwhat you do with them is entirely up to you.

Of course, writing a project in Assembly is very different from using SDL. SDL abstracts the process of accessing hardware directly (for input, drawing, etc.), but it brings you closer to the hardware than high-level engines. Creating this project has been a real challenge: it pushed me to think deeply about the core functionalities of a game like *Tetris* and to implement them in a way that feels natural and intuitive.

I'm aware that my code is far from perfect. It lacks proper design patterns and other architectural considerations‚Äîbut I‚Äôm proud of what I‚Äôve achieved. I encountered many obstacles, thought them through, and managed to overcome them.

Sure, I could‚Äôve made a simple screen where you just play *Tetris*. But I wanted to go further. I wanted to create something personal‚Äîsomething where I could add features I find interesting or useful.

This project is recreational. It‚Äôs a learning journey, and I‚Äôve truly enjoyed every part of it.  
I hope you enjoy what I‚Äôve built and have fun with the gameplay experience. :)
